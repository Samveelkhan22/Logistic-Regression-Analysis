# Logistic Regression Analysis 

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for Logistic Regression. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of logistic regression for classification, particularly in predicting binary outcomes based on a given dataset. 

## Problem Domain
Logistic regression is a widely used classification technique that models the probability of a binary outcome. It is useful for situations where the response variable is categorical, particularly binary (e.g., 0/1, acquired/closed). This project aims to predict the success of startups, classifying them as either "acquired" or "closed" based on various financial and operational features.

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to build a logistic regression model that can predict whether a startup will be acquired or closed based on a dataset of startup characteristics. The model aims to provide insights into which factors most influence these outcomes and how well logistic regression can model this type of data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes various financial and operational metrics of startups, such as location, funding details, and milestones. It contains several columns, such as:

- Latitude and Longitude: Geographic location of the startup.
- Funding Rounds and Total Funding: Financial data on investments.
- Company Status: Binary target variable ('acquired' or 'closed').

## Analysis Workflow
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We explore the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize key features. Descriptive statistics, histograms, and box plots are used to understand the distribution of the data and relationships between variables.

### Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. This step ensures that the data is clean and suitable for model training.

### Model Fitting:
We use the logistic regression model to fit the data. The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

### Results & Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated based on metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. The final model results are interpreted to understand how well it performs and to assess which features are most influential.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of key findings, including the modelâ€™s performance, as well as suggestions for potential improvements or alternative approaches. Limitations of the model and the data used are also discussed.
